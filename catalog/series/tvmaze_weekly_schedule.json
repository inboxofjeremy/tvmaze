The parade follows a 3.5-mile route along Sunset Boulevard and features various celebrities among its participants. Beginning in 1928, Hollywood merchants transformed a one-mile stretch of Hollywood Boulevard into \"Santa Claus Lane\" to boost shopping. Part of the promotion was a daily parade featuring Santa Claus and a film star. Originally called the Santa Claus Lane Parade, the inaugural event featured only Santa Claus and the actress Jeanette Loff.The parade continued to grow in scale with the help of local businesses and the community. In 1931 Santa Claus rode a truck-pulled float instead of the reindeer-pulled carriage of previous years. American LegionPost 43 marched with a color guard, drum line and bugle corps. The Parade was suspended from 1942 to 1944 due to World War II, but reopened in 1945 with record attendance. In 1946 Gene Autry rode his horse in the parade and was inspired by the children yelling \"Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus,\" to write the song \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" along with Oakley Haldeman. Autry would become a perennial Grand Marshal of the parade.The parade continued to grow throughout the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, adding floats, animals, bands and celebrities. By 1978, the parade had been renamed the Hollywood Christmas Parade in order to attract more celebrities, and was broadcast locally on KTLA-TV with the help of Autry and Johnny Grant. This change also coincided with a shift in the parade's scheduling from Thanksgiving Eve to the Sunday after Thanksgiving.",

Each counter is worth $100 and means a shot at the Tipping Point machine to bank money away. Round 2 is called Quickfire, where contestants have 30 seconds to answer questions correctly for a counter. The contestant with the least money at the end of Round 2 will be eliminated from the game. Scattered throughout the machine ledge are two mystery prize counters and two doubles counters for an extra chance to win big. Two contestants move on to Round 3 and go head to head with two questions each. A correct answer earns a counter, but an incorrect answer means forfeiting a counter to your opponent. The person with the most money in the bank moves on . One contestant will then make it to the final Jackpot round and get the chance to take home $20,000. All that's standing in the way is five questions and Todd's secret weapon: his Jackpot Temptation. Jackpot Temptation comes into play if the contestant fails to knock the Jackpot counter over the ledge and win the $20,000, and what a temptation it is. Will Todd offer more counters? More money? A holiday or car? You'll have to tune in to find out.",

Before joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one-third of the time. Good luck, Bill!",

They were the stuff of dreams. Often enormous engineering problems had to be resolved, obstacles overcome and new innovations employed just to get them built in the first place. Alas, a great number of these remarkable structures have now been abandoned, cast aside like enormous expensive out-of-date toys, never to be used in the ways for which they were intended. Each and every one of these extraordinary places is home to a wealth of powerful and compelling stories.

In this 6-part series, presenter Carrie Crowley takes a closer look at six inspiring projects across Ireland, where derelict architectural legacies are being preserved and transformed into vital community spaces.With over 166,000 vacant buildings in Ireland today, BUILDINGS BEO sheds light on the urgent need for renewal of abandoned spaces. With projects ranging from historical mills to old schoolhouses, each episode follows the journey of a different restoration, showcasing the trials, tribulations and triumphs that come with preserving Ireland's architectural heritage.Some of the remarkable restorations include the transformation of the historic Hope Castle Gate Lodge into a thriving community library in Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan, the revival of a railway building into a digital hub and youth centre in Ballinamore, Co. Leitrim, and the redevelopment of a fire-ravaged cinema into a state-of-the-art local theatre in Cork's market town of Macroom. Audiences will be wowed as each episode culminates in a final reveal, as all the hard work comes together and the building is brought back to life.Throughout the series, Carrie meets with the builders, architects, and communities driving these restoration projects, offering viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the transformation process. Through compelling storytelling and stunning visuals, \"Buildings Beo\" celebrates Ireland's rich cultural and architectural heritage, demonstrating how it takes a village to make a Building BEO.

An audio simulcast of the program airs on sister radio network Fox Sports Radio, which is distributed by Premiere Radio Networks. As of 2014, the program has won four Emmy Awards. Fox NFL Sunday debuted on September 4, 1994, when Fox inaugurated its NFL game broadcasts through the network's recently acquired broadcast rights to the National Football Conference; it was originally hosted by James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson (both Brown and Bradshaw had joined the network from CBS to help helm Fox's NFL coverage). The program was notable in being the first hour-long NFL pregame show on a broadcast television network; network pregame programs that existed beforehand, such as CBS' The NFL Today or NBC's NFL Live!, aired as 30-minute broadcasts. Fox's show also adopted a looser, more irreverent approach than its predecessors in order to also appeal to the network's younger-skewing audiences. During Johnson's initial season on Fox NFL Sunday, he would often join the show from his home in Florida. There was much speculation that Jimmy Johnson would return to coaching during the first year of the program's run. Prior to the end of the year, Johnson made an \"announcement,\" saying he was happy with his new career in broadcasting. But in 1996, he left the program to become head coach of the Miami Dolphins; Ronnie Lott was brought in to succeed him, and stayed with the program for two seasons.",

It first aired in 1987 with Tim Brando as host and Lee Corso and Beano Cook as commentators, giving an overview of college football games, but the show underwent a radical transformation beginning in 1993, and began incorporating live broadcasts. The official name of the show is College GameDay built by The Home Depot. There is a separate radio broadcast, ESPN Radio College GameDay, on ESPN Radio. Today, the only original cast member remaining is Lee Corso. Rece Davis serves as host and Kirk Herbstreit is Corso's counterpart. Starting in 2008, Desmond Howardhas been added to the cast in the show's introduction. Craig James served as an analyst from 1990 to 1995. Erin Andrews joined the GameDay crew as a co-host and contributor in 2010, replaced in 2012 by Samantha Ponder. On September 5, 2015, Rece Davis (also host of the college basketball version of GameDay), replaced Chris Fowler as host of the college football version, which itself started its 29th season on that day.The show is known for its prediction segment that appears on each broadcast. Typically there are three predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host university or school for that week. The end of the show always concludes with a catch phrase and prediction from Corso, who subsequently dons the mascot's headgear of the school he predicts to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans. Beginning with the 2013 season, GameDay airs for three hours on ESPN. Previously, beginning in 2010, the first hour of the show was broadcast on ESPNU at 9am ET, with the 2 remaining hours of the show on ESPN from 10am-noon ET.",

However, the rule would not see its first use until 1992, when the Southeastern Conference, which had added Arkansas and South Carolina the previous year, launched its title game. In early 2016, NCAA legislation was passed that largely deregulated FBS conference championship games, allowing a conference with fewer than 12 teams to stage a championship game that featured either (1) the top two teams at the end of a full round-robin conference schedule, or (2) the winners of each of two divisions, with each team playing a full round-robin schedule within its division.[1] Several months later, the Sun Belt Conference announced that they would be introducing a football championship game starting in the 2018 season.",
