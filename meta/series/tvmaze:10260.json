After a massive storm causes the house to flood, David will demo the entire house down to the studs to eradicate mold. When the stress and pressure become too much, he'll make the tough decision to pause the project for a year due to its mental and physical toll. During a healing trip to Norway, David will draw inspiration from the architecture in his ancestral homeland and shift gears away from the fairytale design. Instead, to create his forever dream home, he'll lean into something even more unique that represents this new chapter in his journey."
