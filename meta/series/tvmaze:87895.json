    "description": "Buildings Beo is a property show with a difference: it's not only about the renovation of heritage buildings all around the country, but also about the people and the communities who bring these buildings to life. In this 6-part series, presenter Carrie Crowley takes a closer look at six inspiring projects across Ireland, where derelict architectural legacies are being preserved and transformed into vital community spaces.With over 166,000 vacant buildings in Ireland today, BUILDINGS BEO sheds light on the urgent need for renewal of abandoned spaces. With projects ranging from historical mills to old schoolhouses, each episode follows the journey of a different restoration, showcasing the trials, tribulations and triumphs that come with preserving Ireland's architectural heritage.Some of the remarkable restorations include the transformation of the historic Hope Castle Gate Lodge into a thriving community library in Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan, the revival of a railway building into a digital hub and youth centre in Ballinamore, Co. Leitrim, and the redevelopment of a fire-ravaged cinema into a state-of-the-art local theatre in Cork's market town of Macroom. Audiences will be wowed as each episode culminates in a final reveal, as all the hard work comes together and the building is brought back to life.Throughout the series, Carrie meets with the builders, architects, and communities driving these restoration projects, offering viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the transformation process. Through compelling storytelling and stunning visuals, \"Buildings Beo\" celebrates Ireland's rich cultural and architectural heritage, demonstrating how it takes a village to make a Building BEO.
