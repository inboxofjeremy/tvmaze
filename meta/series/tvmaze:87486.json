A day later, Carson was missing and so was his truck - and his family feared the worst. Sierra Inscoe was caught driving Carson's vehicle, but there was no sign of Carson. Soon, his body was discovered near an oil well, and Inscoe became the prime suspect. As police dug into her social media profiles, a disturbing pattern of deception and crime emerged."
