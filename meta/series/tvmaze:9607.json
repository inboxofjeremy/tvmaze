The celebrities' first challenge is their most daunting yet - to cook an afternoon tea. Each celebrity has just two hours to cook two sweet and two savoury items but they will not only have to impress John and Gregg, but also leading pastry chef Eric Lanlard. Then, in their last challenge as a quartet, the celebrities must cook two dishes of their own design for three of the country's most feared restaurant critics, for a place in the final three. Serving food to these masters of the dining room is a daunting task for even the most adept chefs, and the celebrities' choice of dishes will be key to securing them a place in the final."
