    "description": "Tournament of Champions: All-Star Christmas. And because the holidays are a time for cooking with the ones you love, chefs will be invited to pair up in teams of two to compete for glory and goodwill. In every battle, teams will serve up a savory and a sweet dish based on the spin of the Randomizer. The chef teams will need to be in sync and on their game to earn the title, the belt, a $100,000 cash prize furnished by Carnival Cruise Lines and their split of an additional $50,000 prize to give to a cause close to their hearts.",
