For the past week in an underground medieval courtroom, the closing arguments in Knox's appeal have been unfolding before a jury of two judges, six jurors and a worldwide audience of millions. The proceedings have been intense - the prosecution showing images of the fatal wounds to the victim, Knox's former roommate Meredith Kercher; the defense insisting that the young American is herself a victim of shoddy police work and an overzealous prosecution. As Amanda and her family wait for word that could mean freedom, or a life sentence, Vargas, who has been covering the story from the beginning, reveals never-before-seen letters from Knox to her family, new interviews and access to the investigation, and uncovers details about the prosecutor's questionable past and motives."

        "overview": "Actress Leah Remini reveals in an exclusive interview with ABC News \"20/20\" how Tom Cruise was one of the factors that led her to break from the Church of Scientology. \"Being critical of Tom Cruise is being critical of Scientology itself… you are evil,\" Remini told ABC's Dan Harris in a new promotional clip from the interview. Remini, 45, describes how she and her family joined the Church when she was a young girl, built a successful acting career in Hollywood while being a diligent Scientologist, and how she eventually decided to sever ties with the Church.\"As time goes on, you start to lose touch with the real world. The mindset becomes ‘Us against them,'\" Remini said. \"The decision to leave is you are giving up everything you have ever known and everything you have worked for your whole life.\" The actress also details her 30-year association with the Church in her new memoir, \"Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology.\" \"I feel that people need to understand this has been my whole life,\" Remini said \"I want them to understand how it happens.\""

The story of the Angulo family was revealed through the award-winning documentary \"The Wolfpack,\" focusing on the six brothers - Bhagavan, Govinda, Narayana, Mukunda, Krisna (now Glenn) and Jagadesh (now Eddie) - then ages 11 to 18, and their unusual upbringing, along with their passion for movies, so intense that they copied down entire scripts, constructed costumes and props, memorized lines and acted out entire scenes."

The girls' bodies were discovered in the trunk of J.B.'s car, less than a mile from the payphone, with gunshot wounds to their heads. Despite exhaustive efforts, including attempts to identify unknown male DNA found on one of the girls, the involvement of multiple agencies, national TV appeals, and even attempts at hypnosis of eyewitnesses, the case eventually went cold. In 2019, the use of genetic genealogy led to a breakthrough, resulting in a shocking arrest. Could they have finally found the killer?"

Although there was little physical evidence and no DNA linking any of the men to the crime, a jury convicted Zach at trial — based mainly on Jason's testimony, in which he stated that he had been present when Zach shot and killed Holly. Dylan Adams and Jason Autry both eventually pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Earlier this year, Jason recanted his testimony, saying he made it all up, and while prosecutors stand by the conviction, lawyers for Zach are now asking a judge to grant him a new trial."
