If they fail to answer correctly, their cash prize slips away. The final player remaining will take home everything they've managed to save — making every decision a potential game-changer.",

        "overview": "Quiz, hosted by Sara Davies, in which contestants are given their prize money before they've answered a question, and must race against time to keep hold of it. Each contestant stands before an hourglass-shaped money timer, which begins to drain as the questions are asked - and the only way of stopping it is to answer a question correctly. Once the money is gone, the contestant is out - and only one can make the final to play for the amount they have managed to save."
