Adjoa, an intellectual with the poise of a rom-com heroine, is paired with free-spirited Vim. Their date is a clash of worlds. She adores order, even down to her cleaning products, while he thrives on spontaneity and globe-trotting adventures. Sami turns heads as she finds herself at the centre of attention. Father-of-one Carl is drawn to her charm, while personal trainer Jacques also competes for her attention and possibly even her affections. Should Sami follow her head or her heart? And for Fin and Alex that big question in the sun arises once again: is this a holiday romance, or could it be the start of something long-lasting?"
