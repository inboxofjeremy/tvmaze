    "description": "Baking Championship: Next Gen with hosts and judges, Duff Goldman and Kardea Brown. The pair of culinary experts helm the jam-packed pastry journey that will give a whole new meaning to sibling rivalry when 12 teams of siblings aged 8-14 compete to win $25,000 and become the next generation of Baking Champions. The wholesome and delightful confectionary competition will launch with a supersized two-hour qualifying round to determine who will continue across the eight subsequent episodes to clinch the prize. Once the competition begins, the sibling collaborators will take on tricky challenges like \"breakfast dessert imposters,\" \"cream puff friendship bracelets,\" and \"animated cakes.",

In the first skills test, the nervous teams put up a dozen of their best cupcakes.
