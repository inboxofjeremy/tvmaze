        "overview": "In the Dec. 28 premiere episode, John Stamos will surprise Ken, his best friend of 50 years who shares a passion for music, magic and photography, with an astonishing garage and patio renovation at his childhood home. Ken stopped creating music after the death of his father, so John's vision will gift him an inspiring space to play instruments and relax with family and friends. Drew, Jonathan and John, with sledgehammer and saw in hand, will tear down the old garage walls to create a modern, expanded room that features a new drum set on a portable stage, a sleek workstation with built-ins for needed storage and comfy lounge furniture. Outside, John and the Brothers will add to the ambiance by installing a beautiful paver patio, wood-slat succulent wall and fire pit area."
