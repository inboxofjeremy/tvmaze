    "description": "The world of home cooking is undergoing a revolution with new tastes, flavors, techniques and influences. Christopher Kimball's Milk Street Television wants to change how Americans cook by bringing home a fresher, bolder, simpler way of preparing food. Chris and his test cooks search the world over looking for the best recipes, and finding home cooks who can teach better ways to prepare a meal at home. Chris also shares tips and techniques designed to make home cooking easier, like how to make foolproof egg whites and how to season a carbon steel pan. Back in the kitchen, Chris transforms what the Milk Street Television crew has learned into practical, simple recipes for home cooks everywhere.",

Back at Milk Street, those techniques get put into action as Milk Street Cook Catherine Smart shows Chris how to make Chinese White-Cooked Chicken with Ginger-Soy Dressing. Next, Chris demonstrates why an Asian cleaver just may have the edge over the ubiquitous Western chef's knife. The show ends with a little sizzle on set as Milk Street Cook Matthew Card shows how to make Hot Oil-Flashed Chard with Ginger, Scallions and Chili at home."

Next up is Milk Street Cook Erika Bruce who shows Chris how to make a Brown Sugar Tart with our Foolproof Single-Crust Pie Dough. The show ends with Chris explaining how a Japanese baking technique coupled with a cornstarch paste ended his 30-year search for a prebaked pie crust that won't slump in the pan."
