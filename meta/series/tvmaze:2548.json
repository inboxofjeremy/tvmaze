Annie (Sheila Mercier) leaves a goose for Sandie (Jane Hutcheson) and Phil (Peter Alexander). He thanks her for inviting them both to the farm for Christmas. Jock (Drew Dawson) and Bill (Johnny Caesar) chuckle as Seth makes a phone call in The Woolpack. Dolly (Jean Rogers) takes Sam (Benjamin Whitehead) for a walk through the woods as the youth (Ross Kemp) continues to watch her. Preparations for the nativity play gets underway at St. Mary's Church and Jack (Clive Hornby) helps out. Jack comments to Donald (Hugh Manning) that it's the first time he's been in the church since Pat's funeral. The N.Y. Estates gathering gets underway at Home Farm and Alan (Richard Thorp) is pleased as everyone appears to be enjoying themselves. He's embarrassed, however, when a stripper girl (Rebecca Sowden) dressed up as Santa arrives and kisses him. Annie, Henry (Arthur Pentelow), Amos (Ronald Magill) and Donald look on mortified as Seth, Jock and Bill chortle in the background."

Tricia takes an immediate shine to him at the Woolpack and Diane overhears Gavin say to her that she used to look at him like that. As she leaves to go home Diane warns Gavin she'll not stand to see her Bernice hurt again. And Mandy gets a call to say her dad's been taken ill again. She rushes off telling Paddy she'll be back the following day."
