As the case progresses, Jergens' insecure girlfriend Cora Kennison - an alcoholic and bulimic - becomes an unwilling pawn as both Benson and attorney Minerva Grahame-Bishop seek to persuade Kennison to testify for their respective sides - despite her mother's insistence that her daughter is too fragile.
