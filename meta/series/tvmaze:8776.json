    "description": "The SEC Championship Game (officially The SEC Championship on CBS presented by Dr Pepper for broadcast and sponsorship purposes) is an annual game that has determined the Southeastern Conference's football season champion since 1992. The championship game pits the SEC Western Division regular season champion against the Eastern Division regular season champion and is held a week after the SEC regular season has been completed (typically on the first Saturday of December). Ten of the fourteen current SEC members have played in the SEC Championship Game. Kentucky and Vanderbilt have yet to reach the game from the East, while Ole Miss and Texas A&amp;M have yet to reach the game from the West.",
