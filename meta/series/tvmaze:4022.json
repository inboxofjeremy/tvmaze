    "description": "60 Minutes has been on the air since 1968, beginning on a Tuesday, but spending most of its time on Sundays, where it remains today. This popular news magazine provides both hard hitting investigations, interviews and features, along with people in the news and current events. 60 Minutes has set unprecedented records in the Nielsen's ratings with a number 1 rating, five times, making it among the most successful TV programs in all of television history. This series has won more Emmy awards than any other news program and in 2003, Don Hewitt, the creator (back in 1968), was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Emmy, along with the 60 Minute correspondents. Added to the 11 Peabody awards, this phenomenally long-lived series has collected 78 awards up to the 2005 season and remains among the viewers top choice for news magazine features.",

        "overview": "MTG 2.0 – Correspondent Lesley Stahl sits down with political lightning rod Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in her first interview since abruptly announcing her resignation from Congress. Back in Greene's Georgia district, Stahl talks with the longtime Donald Trump loyalist about her fractured relationship with the president, the state of the America First movement, and whether Greene's reinvention is a genuine evolution or a strategic reset that positions her for a post-Trump world. Denise Schrier Cetta is the producer.Character AI – Amid growing concerns about artificial intelligence's impact on young people and a surge of child-safety lawsuits, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi investigates the next frontier: AI chatbots. She speaks with parents who lost their daughter to suicide, who say chatbots on the popular platform Character AI led her down a dark and sexually explicit path. She also hears from researchers and a psychologist who further reveal the scale – and dangers – of what's unfolding inside this rapidly growing AI technology. Ashley Velie is the producer.Watch Valley – Correspondent Jon Wertheim travels to Switzerland's Vallée de Joux – known as \"Watch Valley\" – where top brands have been refining the art of mechanical watchmaking for centuries. It's a curious time for luxury timepieces, which run – not on batteries – but on springs and gears, as the industry navigates the smartphone era and the ups and downs of President Trump's tariffs. Wertheim meets watchmakers and brand leaders and gets an up-close look at what keeps these mechanical wonders ticking. Nathalie Sommer is the producer."

The vice president will appear, with his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, on television for the first time since announcing Wednesday that he will not seek the Democratic presidential nomination.The New Burma - 60 Minutes goes to Burma before the country's historic elections to report on its democratic movement and speak to the Nobel Prize-winning woman most responsible for it. Bill Whitaker reports from the former military dictatorship and speaks to the iconic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Inside the Air War - On the combat operations floor of the nerve center for the air war against ISIS, David Martin and 60 Minutes cameras watch as a B-1 bomber zeroes in on its target. On one wall they can see a map tracking all the planes -- including Russian -- over Iraq and Syria. On another wall, they watch a live-video feed from an unmanned drone orbiting the target -- a cluster of buildings which U.S. intelligence believes is hiding an ISIS car bomb factory. Lt. Gen. Charles Brown, the commander of the air war, joins them on the operations floor and describes the strike as it unfolds in real time. This is the first-ever look inside the command center -- located in a bunker-like building in the Persian Gulf country of Qatar -- for the 14-month-old air campaign against ISIS. The air war costs the U.S. $10 million-a-day and Lt. Gen. Brown describes for Martin the amount of work that single B-1 strike entailed. \"Scheduling-wise [its] about a three-day process and some of those targets we've looked at for...days, weeks and sometimes months,\" he tells Martin. The mission 60 Minutes follows results in the destruction of the buildings with secondary explosions indicating that explosives were stored inside. It is one of 47 such facilities the U.S. and allied planes have hit over the past six weeks. Brown acknowledges that ISIS will probably set up another factory elsewhere, but that, he says, is the nature of this war, which pits a superpower against an enemy intent on dragging the Middle East back to the Middle Ages."

The dealers are going where the money is and they're cultivating a new set of consumers: high school students, college athletes, teachers and professionals.Heroin is showing up everywhere -- in places like Columbus, Ohio . The area has long been viewed as so typically Middle American that, for years, many companies have gone there to test new products.

But after two weeks, he knew he was in trouble and wondered why the people at the U.S. Agency for International Development who had hired him hadn't come to his rescue. Gross was an electronics consultant hired by USAID to set up independent Internet connections in Cuba, an illegal activity because it bypassed censorship in the communist country. His efforts landed him in custody for five years until he was released last December on the same day the U.S. released three Cubans it held. Gross tells Scott Pelley about his ordeal and his activities that led up to his arrest in his first interview.The Execution of Joseph Wood- The execution of a man in Arizona with a new cocktail of drugs was supposed to take about 10 minutes. It took almost two hours, the longest execution in U.S. history.Taking on the Eiger - If a villain were about to kill James Bond at the top of a Swiss peak, 007 might make an incredible escape like this. And JT Holmes would be the stuntman to pull it off. The extreme sportsman has been waiting for years to try it. And when the weather was finally right, he flew, skied and then jumped off the Eiger's rock face, pulling a parachute to break his 100-mph free fall. 60 Minutes cameras were there to record the breathtaking event, tried by Holmes for the first time on the famous peak that's more than two miles high."

In addition, Rose speaks to Apple design chief Jonathan Ive, who lets 60 Minutes cameras into his studio for a rare look at the process that gave birth to revolutionary products like the iPhone and iPad.Michael Caine - After making films for over 50 years, Michael Caine says his latest is his best work ever. The 82-year-old British actor tells Lesley Stahl that playing the role of Fred Ballinger in the new film \"Youth\" was also his most difficult. Caine talks about his latest movie and his incredible career on the next edition of 60 Minutes Sunday, Dec. 20 at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT.\"Secretly, I regarded it as the best thing I ever did,\" Caine says of \"Youth,\" a film about aging in which he plays a retired conductor and composer. \"It was the most difficult and the criterion for that is that I made it look the most easy,\" he says. The octogenarian actor says he needs the challenge the role posed because, he jokes with Stahl, \"I don't get the girl anymore. All I get is grandma.\" But he tells Stahl being a grandpa is his biggest kick. Ten years ago he began playing Alfred the butler in the Batman trilogy of films. \"My grandson looked up at me and said, 'Do you know Batman?' I said 'Yes....I know him very well.' And he told all the boys at school, 'My grandpa knows Batman. Does your grandpa know Batman?'\" There is talk of a nomination for best actor; he would be the oldest person to win that Oscar. He has won for best supporting actor twice."

        "overview": "James Comey - In 2014, then-FBI director James Comey spoke to Scott Pelley about his job and the political independence it required in order to effectively uphold the rule of law.The Bin Laden Documents - Bin Laden documents reveal a loving, vengeful son who might take his father's role atop an al Qaeda that's stronger than ever, says ex-FBI agent. Personal letters seized in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden reveal the al Qaeda leader's son to be a young man who adores his father and wants to carry on his murderous ideology. That son today is poised to lead a stronger, larger al Qaeda and is bent on avenging his dad's death, says an ex-FBI agent familiar with those documents. Holly Williams interviews Ali Soufan, the former FBI agent who was the bureau's lead investigator of al Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks. Soufan describes a letter from the son, Hamza, that was collected in the raid and now declassified. \"He tells him that…he remembers 'every look…every smile you gave me, every word you told me.'\" Hamza would be about 28 now and wrote the letter when he was 22 and had not seen his father in several years. Hamza also wrote this: \"I consider myself to be forged in steel. The path of jihad for the sake of God is what we live.\"Curiosity - Rover \"Curiosity\" explores whether life could have begun on Mars. Is Earth the only planet in our solar system that has life on it? Scientists can't say for sure, but it's possible life could have flourished on Mars based on data gleaned by the Mars rover \"Curiosity.\" Bill Whitaker reports on the sights and data beamed back more than 30-million miles from Mars by Curiosity, information that's telling scientists a lot about the Red Planet and Earth. Whitaker visits the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to bring viewers on a trip to Mars. JPL monitors show incredible images from its surface, such as a sunset and Martian terrain. But information from Curiosity's internal lab offers evidence of essential organic chemicals, leading JPL's Chief Engineer Rob Manning to consider an even wilder trip. \"Could have been that Mars was habitable before Earth was and life got its foothold on Mars and took its journey to Earth and we're all Martians.\" Manning explains. \"When a meteor comes along and hits Mars, a rock from Mars can be lifted up, travel in circles around the sun until someday it will bump into Earth,\" he tells Whitaker. \"We've found Mars rock…we've found them all over the Earth.\" Manning says Earth rocks have traveled to Mars in the same way and that it's possible life could have survived the journey."

Robin Hynicka and his congregation are certainly circumventing U.S. immigration law by sheltering an illegal immigrant inside the Arch St. Methodist Church in Philadelphia. But Rev. Hynicka answers to a higher law. He says the immigration policy ordering the deportation of Javier Flores Garcia is unjust – a law God gives him the power to question. And he's not the only cleric in the U.S. who feels and acts this way. As Scott Pelley reports, Arch St. Methodist is just one of more than 800 churches and synagogues offering sanctuary to illegal immigrants in response to the new crackdown ordered by the Trump administration. Cook County Jail - Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart runs one of the largest jails in the country, located in Chicago. But it's his unconventional and controversial style that puts him in the spotlight.Enemy of the State - Art that's relevant is political, says provocative Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Ai Weiwei's work has gotten him harassed by police, thrown in detention and driven out of the country. But in order to be relevant, he must be political, as he tells Holly Williams. The acclaimed artist has left China and is now staying in Germany, he says, out of concern for the safety of his young son. But he doesn't rule out moving back to China, where authorities tried to censor his work, which they considered subversive. In one famous piece, he photographed himself giving the middle finger to a portrait of China's revered former dictator Mao Zedong."

The goal is to force Russia to withdraw its army and agree not to attack Ukraine again. Sharyn Alfonsi sits down with deputy national security advisor Daleep Singh, the Biden administration's point man on the sanctions and architect of this \"war by other means.\" Alfonsi reports on the impact of the sanctions, the risk, and the potential for collateral damage on the U.S. economy and the rest of the world. Through The Roof – 60 MINUTES travels to a hot housing market and examines the rental madness affecting millions of Americans. With residential rents nationwide up 15% last year, nearly twice the overall inflation rate, Lesley Stahl looks at the factors behind the jump – supply and demand first among them. While millions of people need rental housing, very little rental housing has been built in the last decade. At the same time, big investment firms are buying up rental properties, most of them in \"hot\" Sun Belt rental markets, and in turn, would-be first-time homebuyers have to compete against Wall Street giants. The financial impossibility for many keeps people as tenants renting, which keeps rental demand high and can drive rents even higher. Sue Bird – Jon Wertheim profiles one of the greatest players in WNBA history and one of basketball's generational stars.

The \"City of Lions\" is the nickname for Lviv, Ukraine. Londongrad – One of the ways the West is hoping to derail Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is by waging war on his inner circle: the hundreds of mega-rich oligarchs who hide Putin's money abroad and prop up his regime. For decades, Britain has actively courted the Russian billionaires, ignoring reports of their suspicious wealth. Billions of dollars poured in. Today, there's so much Russian cash in London; the capital is nicknamed \"Londongrad.\" Now, with Russia laying waste to Ukraine, Britain is under pressure to show it can stop the flood of corrupt money. Bill Whitaker goes to the heart of Russia's capital abroad – London – to find out. Laurie Anderson – 60 MINUTES' Anderson Cooper profiles artist Laurie Anderson, one of America's most unusual – and visionary – creative pioneers.
