    "description": "New Year's Eve Live with Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen is an annual program broadcast on CNN. It originates live from Times Square in New York City. It covers the traditional ball drop live, but also reports on other New Year's Eve celebrations across the country and around the world. It is a competing program to similar shows such as New Year's Rockin' Eve, All American New Year and New Year's Eve with Carson Daly in the United States. Overseas, the program is simulcast on CNN International and available around the world. The program has drawn controversy and attention, largely with respect to Kathy Griffin's antics, comments, and double entendres.",
