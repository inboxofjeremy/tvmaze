    "description": "For the first time Guy Fieri is heading back to some of his all-time favorite Diners, Drive-ins and Dives spots on Triple D Nation. On this all-new spin on DDD, Guy checks in on some of the most memorable joints he has previously visited to see how they have been doing, and to get a taste of some of the new and classic recipes they are dishing out. Whether they have opened new locations, expanded their old ones, or added to their menus, these restaurants are always pushing the boundaries of their culinary comfort zone.",

A mom-and-pop taco spot in Phoenix isn't slowing down anytime soon, now at multiple locations and still serving a taste of Chihuahua with lights-out lengua and beefed-up gorditas. Then, in Boston, real-deal Italian is going strong, plating craveable faves like a marinated steak tip sandwich and next-level eggplant parm. Plus, a not-your-typical butcher is bringing even more \"meatless\" to the Minneapolis masses, puttin' their plant-based stamp on a huli-huli rib panini and the-bomb bacon brat."
