    "description": "The show follows collectors as they discover the true monetary value of their massive and unusual collections. From an overwhelming stash of superhero figurines to cramped spaces stuffed with rare puppets and dolls and miniature sets that leave no room for actual, life-size furniture – these homes are begging for professional help, and the collectors must decide whether they are willing to sell some of their items to pay for the much-needed renovation. With a combination of humor, compassion and a celebration of the passionate collector in all of us, Bobby will support the homeowners through the process of sorting through, appraising and letting go of their stockpile, discovering the ‘found money' along the way to achieving their dream makeover.",

Once the pieces bring top dollar at auction, Bobby will bring new life to the spaces—and most importantly, calm to Patrick and Roger's lives—with stunning lighting, flooring and furniture as well as custom built-ins that provide the ideal display and essential storage for the cherished keepsakes."
