    "description": "In 2012, Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK joined forces to launch Stand Up to Cancer in the UK, to accelerate life-saving cancer research. Led by the brightest stars in film, TV and music, it was the most successful charity fundraiser on UK commercial TV in its first year - ever.Following on from that, the campaign has now raised over £23.8 million. The money raised so far has been spent funding clinical trials, which aim to improve survival rates and bring breakthroughs in labs to the patients who need them. Over 9,000 people have, or are about to benefit from these cutting edge trials, and this is still only the beginning.",

Cameras follow patients and their families through pivotal moments, from the shock of diagnosis to the challenges of treatment and life-changing test results, revealing both the medical and deeply human experience of facing cancer. The programme also explores the UK's screening services and the crucial role that they play in saving lives.

The programme shows how spotting the signs early can make all the difference, and how advances in technology and compassionate care are transforming outcomes for patients across the country. It aims to demystify what happens inside a cancer clinic, challenge the fears that stop many from getting checked, and show that taking that first step towards early diagnosis could be the most important decision you ever make."

        "released": "2025-12-12",
        "overview": "Davina McCall presents this groundbreaking documentary, live from inside a one-off cancer clinic at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for Stand Up To Cancer, offering unprecedented access to the world of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Cameras follow patients and their families through pivotal moments, from the shock of diagnosis to the challenges of treatment and life-changing test results, revealing both the medical and deeply human experience of facing cancer. The programme also explores the UK's screening services and the crucial role that they play in saving lives. Among the patients featured are those diagnosed with breast and lung cancer, two of the nation's most common and deadliest forms of the disease. The programme shows how spotting the signs early can make all the difference, and how advances in technology and compassionate care are transforming outcomes for patients across the country. It aims to demystify what happens inside a cancer clinic, challenge the fears that stop many from getting checked, and show that taking that first step towards early diagnosis could be the most important decision you ever make."
