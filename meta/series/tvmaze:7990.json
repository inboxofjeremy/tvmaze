    "description": "The College Football Playoff: Top 25 is a weekly sports talk show that began in October 2014 because the BCS (Bowl Championship Selection committee) no longer existed. A new committee was then formed to decide the best Top 25 NCAA football teams in the Nation. Based on a very complicated system of points the Top 4 teams at the end of the regular college football season would be required to play each other in a playoff to determine the best team in the Nation which would be the last team standing. This show beginning every October will announce the Top 25 teams each week and then the College Football analysts and experts will discuss that week's poll results.",
