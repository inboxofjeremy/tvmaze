    "description": "NBC Sunday Night Football is a weekly television broadcast of National Football League (NFL) games on NBC in the United States. It began airing on August 6, 2006 with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, which opened that year's preseason. NBC took over the rights to the Sunday prime time game telecasts from ESPN, which carried the broadcasts from 1987 to 2005 (concurrently with NBC assuming the rights to Sunday evening regular-season games).",

Live from GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. The Texans and Chiefs meet for the 17th time on Sunday, including the postseason, with Kansas City holding an 11-5 advantage in the series. Houston and Kansas City met twice last season, with their most recent matchup in the AFC Divisional Round, which the Chiefs won, 23-14, en route to the team's fifth Super Bowl appearance in six seasons. Preceding that was a 27-19 Chiefs win."
