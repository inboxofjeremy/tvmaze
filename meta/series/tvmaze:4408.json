        "overview": "Molly Bish was just 16 years old when she went missing on June 27, 2000. She vanished after being dropped off at her lifeguarding job. What followed became the largest search in Massachusetts history. Her remains were eventually discovered, but her killer has never been identified. Decades later, Bish's sister turns to social media, sharing her family's story and urging the public to help generate new leads. 48 HOURS correspondent Erin Moriarty reports on the renewed push for answers."

Such a revelation would shatter any family and challenge even the most faithful.

I think he gave me that gift so that when I found out that it was my son, that it would be a legitimate forgiveness.\" Whitaker hopes he can persuade the Texas jury to forgive his only living son, but first his son must convince that same jury that he is no longer a threat to anyone - inside or out of prison."

The broadcast will investigate the story behind McLaughlin's death, including the suspected roles played by his fiancée Nanette Johnston, and former NFL linebacker Eric Naposki, who speaks to 48 HOURS MYSTERY in his first on-camera interview. McLaughlin was a devoted father and family man, who, following a 1990 divorce, began seeing and ultimately became engaged to a much younger Nanette Johnston who was later discovered to have a habit of seeking out wealthy men to date. Following McLaughlin's death, Nanette was questioned by police, but she had an alibi. However, the would-be Orange County housewife had a shocking secret that would soon be revealed: her relationship with former NFL linebacker Eric Naposki, who had his own plans of marrying Nanette. But police never had enough to bring this case to justice. Now, finally, a family and a community will get the answers to who killed Bill McLaughlin."

Now, 48 HOURS reports on a new investigation into the case. Early on, rumors that the Murdaughs were somehow involved in Smith's death spread through town.

During that investigation, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) announced it had uncovered a new lead in Smith's death and would be taking over the case.
