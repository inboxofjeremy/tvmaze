In Northampton, a man with a history of violence wanted for multiple assaults earlier in the day is refusing to come quietly, leaving the interceptors no option but to take him down with 50,000 volts. Over in Silverstone, Callum and Chris are after a driver treating the holiday Inn car park as his very own racetrack, while a pursuit across multiple counties is finally brought to an end by Dan and the team, with a little help from the eye in the sky."

        "overview": "Police Interceptors is back in Nottinghamshire for another series alongside the region's elite crimefighting units. In one of the most challenging years ever for law enforcement, this series features exclusive access to Nottinghamshire's traffic units, its knife crime team and armed response unit. Racing in performance patrol cars with the best drivers on the road, hunting with the dog unit in the undergrowth and peering through the sights of an automatic rifle, this is a high-octane documentary in the thick of the war on crime. Doors get smashed in dawn raids on drug dealers, shots are fired in a suburban siege and bad guys are chased at more than 100 miles per hour. The battle may have never been fiercer, but Nottinghamshire's finest are up to it."

They arrive to find the stock seemingly abandoned, when nearby a figure bursts from the shadows and legs it into the undergrowth. Dog detectives take the lead on containment, and it's down to police dog Morse and his canine comrade Reno to sniff out the bad guys. Jon and Dan stop a road rage suspect who has allegedly racially abused another driver and threatened them with an axe. The bloke evidently has an axe to grind with the interceptors, too, and this charming encounter unearths more than just a weapon. Déjà vu strikes, as the knife crime team nick a familiar face with a load of suspected cannabis in his mum's motor. The lad claims he uses the stash to whip up cannabis cakes and shakes — so much so the team think he could have set up shop. Meanwhile, there's another reunion in store for Lewis. One year on from a siege in suburbia, where a man fired an imitation pistol towards armed cops, he's made more threats towards police and the hunt is on to lock him up. Finally, having the windows down on a hot summer's day has Matt and Lee following their noses to weed out their next job. High speed, high drama and one hell of a ride. Buckle up for an all-new episode of Police Interceptors."
