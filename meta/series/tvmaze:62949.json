        "overview": "There are now 20 Taskmaster Champions swanning around, revelling in the prestige of owning the coveted golden trophy that looks a tiny bit like the Taskmaster, Greg Davies. Only three of those winners can also claim to be Champion of Champions - but now a fourth name will be added to that elite list, as the five most recent series victors collide in this epic one-off battle to see who's best at poetic rodeo, bigging themselves up and just generally being brilliant. The five former champs who are greedy for more glory are Andy Zaltzman, John Robins, Maisie Adam, Mathew Baynton and Sam Campbell, and they've all made startling costume choices for their tilt at immortality. The fiendish tasks they attempt are, of course, administrated by the world's most efficient assistant, Alex Horne, while Greg hands down judgements that will decide the fate of this fantastic fivesome."
