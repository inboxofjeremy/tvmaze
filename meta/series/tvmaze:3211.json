    "description": "Since the premiere of his groundbreaking series African American Lives through the first season of Finding Your Roots, noted Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has been helping people discover long-lost relatives hidden for generations within the branches of their family trees. Professor Gates utilizes a team of genealogists to reconstruct the paper trail left behind by our ancestors and the world's leading geneticists to decode our DNA and help us travel thousands of years into the past to discover the origins of our earliest forebears.",

And Sedgwick's ancestor Theodore Sedgwick argued the freedom case of Elizabeth Freeman, also known as \"Mumbet,\" in 1781 -- which helped bring an end to slavery in Massachusetts. We reveal this fact - and many others - to Sedgwick and Bacon in this episode, and learn quite a bit about slavery in the North in the process."

But along the way, the stories of their Greek ancestors were lost. In recovering these stories, we'll find that their ancestors overcame terrible hardship, and showed remarkable courage in times of war. For Tina Fey, we discover her 5th great-grandfather survived a terrible massacre, and became a hero in the Greek War of Independence. We reveal that David Sedaris' ancestors were also touched by the Greek War of Independence. Their home village was raided by the Ottoman military, and David's great grand-aunt was taken captive -- never to see her family again. And we learn that George Stephanopoulos' family was willing to sacrifice their own lives in the struggle against the Nazi occupation of Greece during World War I."

Janet Mock follows the Mock surname to Louisiana and her maternal roots to Hawaii, where her second great-grandparents were farm laborers.
