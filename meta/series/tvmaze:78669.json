Olympic champion diver and knitting enthusiast Tom Daley guides our knitters as they create unique makes and larger-than-life projects, from clothing and jewellery to home accessories and furniture, while judges Di Gilpin and Shelia Greenwell decide whose creative approaches and techniques will be cast off each week. With five knitters left, it's Statement Week for the quarter-final. In the solo challenge, the knitters make bold, eye-catching jewellery, and in the team challenge, they create delicate lace for a lighting feature. But when the switch is flicked, there's nowhere to hide. Any mistake will be glaringly obvious, so perfection is the only option. Whose lace will bag them a semi-final place, and whose jewellery will leave them hanging?"
