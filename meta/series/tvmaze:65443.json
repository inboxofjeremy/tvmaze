        "released": "2025-12-17",
        "overview": "Christmas is one of the most important periods of the year for the Legoland resort in Windsor. The countdown is well and truly underway as the team have just weeks to transform the 150-acre site into a winter wonderland, before up to 20,000 guests a day start pouring through the gates. With 700 real Christmas trees arriving on site, the world's biggest Lego Christmas tree to piece together, and so many festive guests to keep happy, it's going to be a busy, busy time. There's also a Christmas jumper dog day, grottos to build, and festive shows to rehearse, as one of the UK's busiest resorts turns the Christmas cheer up to the max. The model makers are also busy sprinkling festive cheer across the park, with models big and small, as they create giant Lego displays and transform the intricate scenes of Miniland."

        "released": "2025-12-18",
        "overview": "A bottle of Baileys is sold every two seconds during the festive season, the company's most important time of the year. This festive one-off documentary has exclusive access to the business as it ramps up production to satisfy the Christmas demand, at a time when it also has high hopes for an ambitious new launch: a Terry's Chocolate Orange-flavoured Baileys drink. On the Irish farm that supplies the cream at the heart of Baileys, even the cows have some Christmas cheer - with some high-tech bovine Christmas gifts and festive playlists to relax them as they're milked. The creative teams are dreaming up campaigns to boost Christmas demand with celebrity influencers whipping up a social media storm. And the factories are working flat out to meet festive demand as the liquid scientists' creations start pouring off the production line."

We go behind the scenes of the Bergensbanen for an intimate look into the lives of those who reside and work along the route of one of the most breathtaking train rides in the world."

        "overview": "A bottle of Baileys is sold every two seconds during the festive season, the company's most important time of the year. This festive one-off documentary has exclusive access to the business as it ramps up production to satisfy the Christmas demand, at a time when it also has high hopes for an ambitious new launch: a Terry's Chocolate Orange-flavoured Baileys drink. On the Irish farm that supplies the cream at the heart of Baileys, even the cows have some Christmas cheer - with some high-tech bovine Christmas gifts and festive playlists to relax them as they're milked. The creative teams are dreaming up campaigns to boost Christmas demand with celebrity influencers whipping up a social media storm. And the factories are working flat out to meet festive demand as the liquid scientists' creations start pouring off the production line."
