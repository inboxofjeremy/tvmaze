Under the watchful eye of senior designer Dave O'Donnell, the team have just five days to install seven treasure-themes tales - including a golden goose, a mermaid's grotto, Treasure Island, Aladdin's cave, a giant beanstalk and a full-sized Jolly Roger, because nothing says Christmas like a skull-and-crossbones - as long as it's sparkly!"

        "overview": "Top designers Adrian Lillie and Charlotte Lloyd Webber are taking on a brief fit for a queen this Christmas at Kensington Palace. They've been commissioned to create an installation that marks 190 years since the future Queen Victoria spent Christmas in the seaside town of Ramsgate in Kent. With beautiful floristry, bespoke decorations and a picture-perfect dolls house all being crafted by hand, the team will capture the magical atmosphere of the Princess's seaside surroundings in 1835. Christmas 2025 is a season of firsts for the designers: as well as taking on their first royal residence, they're also launching an installation at London's fabulous Chiswick House. Inspired by the carol The Twelve Days of Christmas, complete with lords a-leaping, it should be a dream setting. Except for one thing: due to the historic nature of the buildings, there's a strict no-glitter policy. Can the team find a solution?"
