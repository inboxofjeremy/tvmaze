The third leg of this antiques odyssey with Catherine Southon and Philip Serrell sees them taking the old Citroen through the west country. Catherine decides to change her buying strategy, going for more of Philip's rust-and-woodworm fare. True to form, Phil diverts to the beach and asks a local fisherman if he has some antique chandlery to sell. When not shopping, Phil heads deep underground to see where miners have extracted Beer stone for two centuries, which has been used to build some of Britain's most famous buildings, including Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London. Meanwhile, Catherine goes giddy when she learns how Bakelite changed the world and even put man into space."
