    "description": "The Big Fat Quiz is an annual British television programme broadcast on the last Sunday of the year on Channel 4. Essentially, the show is a comedy panel show in the style of a pub quiz. Three teams, of two celebrities each, are asked questions relating to the events of the year just gone by, which they write answers to on an electronic board in front of them. At the end of each round, they then display their answers, scoring a point for each correct one. The first edition was broadcast in December 2004. There has been another at the end of each year since, as well as a special edition in November 2007 for Channel 4's 25th anniversary celebrations.",

        "overview": "What was the first thing that Katy Perry did when she returned from space? Why did two members of the public go viral for attending a Coldplay concert together? And what did Lily Allen allegedly find in the West Village apartment? All of these questions and more will be answered in the Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2025. Question master Jimmy Carr is joined by Jonathan Ross, Richard Ayoade, Katherine Ryan, Nick Mohammed, Roisin Conaty and Lou Sanders, as they battle it out to see who knows the most about the year that's been. Helping Jimmy to ask the big questions are Charles Dance, the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School and a host of celebrity question-setters."
