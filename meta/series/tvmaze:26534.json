    "description": "On the heels of the success of 90 Day Fiancé and spinoff series 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, comes a second spinoff series 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. The newest linear addition to the franchise will follow couples who have an existing relationship online, but have not met in person. Viewers will experience their journey as they travel to the other's foreign country for the first time in an attempt to establish a relationship. At the end of the trip, the couple faces a choice: do they continue down a path towards a proposal and engagement to then begin the K-1 visa process, or will one of them be heading home with a broken heart?",
