From space, images revealed the scale of the millions displaced in Gaza. Spy satellites tracked the clandestine movements of arms from North Korea to Russia. And scientists have counted wildebeest and walrus to keep tabs on the health of the planet. Satellites even witnessed SpaceX launch a rocket, looking back from space. These stories defined the year, and the view from space reveals their magnitude and the truth behind the headlines. Unpacked through news archive, witness testimony, user-generated material and expert analysis, this is the unseen story of 2025 on Earth."
