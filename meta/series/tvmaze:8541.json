        "overview": "It's been reported that a key witness in Prince Harry's high-stakes case against the publishers of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday has dramatically claimed that an earlier witness statement in his name was made up. Prince Harry and six other high-profile public figures, including Sir Elton John, Liz Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, accuse the papers of law-breaking, including phone hacking and bugging, to obtain stories. Associated Newspapers says the allegations are 'preposterous smears'. With the trial due to start in the new year, Dispatches examines what's been going on - and what the case means for Harry's wider war with the press and his relationship with his family."

        "overview": "Every seven seconds a parcel is stolen in Britain. With Christmas just around the corner, Dispatches goes on a mission to catch the crooks behind the escalating crime wave. The eye-opening film reveals the stark reality of Britain's disappearing doorstep deliveries, showing how it's become big business for criminal gangs. Reporter Tir Dhondy meets victims frustrated that their parcels keep going missing, even though they have doorbell footage of the criminals at work.To investigate what happens with stolen deliveries, Tir hides tiny tracking devices in parcels and leaves them on doorsteps. When they're stolen, the thieves have no idea that Tir is secretly following on their tail, ready to challenge them. Tir finds out how one doorstep thief susses out which homes offer the prime pickings, and learns that parcel theft is no longer just a petty crime for opportunist thieves but a lucrative business model for criminal gangs, costing more than an estimated £650m a year. Tir also discovers the shocking reality of how violent organised gangs are hijacking delivery vans, sometimes with deadly consequences. And how stressed-out delivery drivers are frightened in their daily work. With exclusive access to a major police operation, Tir sees first-hand how the cops are tracking and tackling the organised gangs who are determined to pinch our festive purchases."

Many older people in this country are facing serious problems with their home care. For Dispatches, Jackie Long investigates the fate of some of Britain's most vulnerable pensioners, who rely on council-funded home care. Working as a frontline carer, an undercover reporter discovers an overstretched service, concerns about pay not meeting the minimum wage and workers cutting short appointments and falsifying log books. Dispatches sets up hidden cameras in one pensioner's home to find out more about the standard of care she receives. The introduction of the living wage means care costs could soar, at the same time as care budgets have been slashed. The industry body, representing care companies, now warns that the market is increasingly unviable."

Hundreds of thousands of disabled people are now having to apply for this new benefit and many claim it is deeply unfair.

Birmingham has faced 27 serious case reviews over the last 10 years. Earlier this month, a woman was found guilty of brutally murdering 18-month old baby Keegan Downer, who Birmingham's Children's Services had placed with her after Keegan was removed from her drug-addicted birth mother. Keegan is just the latest of several children killed in the city in recent years by those supposed to be caring for them. Birmingham City Council has insisted that sorting out its Children's Services is a top priority, and claims that substantial improvements have been made."

Dispatches has discovered that there are now more than 100 baby banks in the UK, the vast majority of which have been set up since the austerity programme began. For the first time, Dispatches has surveyed these baby banks, to get a sense of who they're serving and the services they're providing. The results of this ground-breaking survey show that demand has increased significantly. We meet working parents who can't afford the most basic essentials and have to rely on baby banks to provide for their children."

But how much demand is there for a multi-billion-pound high-speed line connecting London to Birmingham, and then Manchester and Leeds, when the capital is already connected to these cities? As the construction of HS2 begins in earnest, Dispatches hears from those calling for HS2 to be cancelled and from northern commuters furious that it will siphon off cash needed to improve the state of their local rail services.

As the death toll rises, the programme looks at everything from seismic changes in economic policy to shifts in the way we view and treat other people, and from a drop in pollution to the widening of the gaps between rich and poor, young and old. The programme asks what a post-Covid 19 Britain, torn apart by the disease, might look like, and the potential changes to the way people live their lives for years to come."

Government public health guidance says regular cleaning of surfaces plays a vital role in limiting the transmission of Covid-19 in public settings. In a national experiment, the programme tests the cleanliness of the surfaces people might encounter on a commute, or going for a drink, a meal or a mini staycation?

        "overview": "Millions of workers in the UK could lose their jobs because of the artificial intelligence revolution. According to experts the impact on a range of industries could be dramatic, with skilled work particularly affected. As AI develops rapidly, with claims it can outperform humans in most tasks, Dispatches undertakes a bold and unique experiment that pitches human against machine to find out how true that is. Four professionals are invited into a specially-created test centre to compete in a set of identical tasks against their AI counterparts: a GP; a fashion photographer; a trainee solicitor; and a composer. With reputations as well as jobs at stake, who comes out on top - humans or AI?"

        "overview": "It's been reported that a key witness in Prince Harry's high-stakes case against the publishers of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday has dramatically claimed that an earlier witness statement in his name was made up. Prince Harry and six other high-profile public figures, including Sir Elton John, Liz Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, accuse the papers of law-breaking, including phone hacking and bugging, to obtain stories. Associated Newspapers says the allegations are 'preposterous smears'. With the trial due to start in the new year, Dispatches examines what's been going on - and what the case means for Harry's wider war with the press and his relationship with his family."

        "released": "2025-12-19",
        "overview": "Every seven seconds a parcel is stolen in Britain. With Christmas just around the corner, Dispatches goes on a mission to catch the crooks behind the escalating crime wave. The eye-opening film reveals the stark reality of Britain's disappearing doorstep deliveries, showing how it's become big business for criminal gangs. Reporter Tir Dhondy meets victims frustrated that their parcels keep going missing, even though they have doorbell footage of the criminals at work.To investigate what happens with stolen deliveries, Tir hides tiny tracking devices in parcels and leaves them on doorsteps. When they're stolen, the thieves have no idea that Tir is secretly following on their tail, ready to challenge them. Tir finds out how one doorstep thief susses out which homes offer the prime pickings, and learns that parcel theft is no longer just a petty crime for opportunist thieves but a lucrative business model for criminal gangs, costing more than an estimated £650m a year. Tir also discovers the shocking reality of how violent organised gangs are hijacking delivery vans, sometimes with deadly consequences. And how stressed-out delivery drivers are frightened in their daily work. With exclusive access to a major police operation, Tir sees first-hand how the cops are tracking and tackling the organised gangs who are determined to pinch our festive purchases."
