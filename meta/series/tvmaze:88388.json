    "description": "Join comedian, raconteur, and musician Bill Bailey as he travels the length of modern Vietnam on the 50th anniversary of the dramatic withdrawal of the US forces from Saigon. Immersing himself in its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and complex history he uncovers what makes this fascinating country tick. From the centuries old hill tribes of the north, to the bustling markets of Ho Chi Minh City and the breathtaking hidden beaches of Ha Long Bay, Bill will show that there is so much more to this country than a legacy of war and conflict. Vietnam is a country that is always looking forward despite its past. Vietnam is unpredictable, chaotic and – at times – infuriatingly bureaucratic… but these are things Bill embraces on a journey no ordinary traveller would dare undertake beyond the tourist trails.",
