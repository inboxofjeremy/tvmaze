      "description": "The Price is Right, originally hosted by Bob Barker until 2007 and Drew Carey thereafter -- features a wide variety of games and contests with the same basic challenge: Guess the prices of everyday (or not-quite-everyday) retail items. Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the \"Showcase Showdown\". The two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. A trio of models presents the prizes.",

Here you'll find a posh gated community with winding tree-lined streets and luxurious mansions to call home. At the center of this community are the Duprees, a powerful and prestigious multi-generational family that is the very definition of Black royalty. But behind these pristine walls and lush, manicured gardens are juicy secrets and scandals waiting to be uncovered. And those that live outside these gates are watching closely. These are the places where our characters live, love, work and play. Those who have \"made it\" and those who haven't are all trying to navigate life … and some with more grace than others.",

And there's plenty of funny moments too. Classic characters old and new across thousands of episodes have shared a drink in The Queen Vic, shed tears of despair or joy, sat on Arthur's bench in the Square... and at some point or other they probably crossed paths with Ian Beale.",

Determined to become a painter, she arrives under pressure: her parents expect her to rise to the top of her class within six months or return home.Lili's drive intensifies when she encounters Kit Church, a gifted aristocratic student known for his talent and detachment. While Kit has devoted himself entirely to painting, Lili's sincerity and resilience begin to shift something in him. The two share little beyond their love for art, yet their relationship quickly becomes central to life at the academy.",

It takes place in the idyllic English town of Sanctuary, where for hundreds of years witches have lived peacefully, as valued members of society. Until now... At the heart of the story is Sarah Fenn, Sanctuary's resident witch, on whom the town relies to solve their problems when conventional remedies have failed. When local teen rugby star, Dan Whithall, dies tragically in an apparent accident, his death exposes a terrifying undercurrent of suspicion and fear towards Sarah and her teenage daughter, Harper. Mother of the dead boy, Abigail, once Sarah's closest friend, is wracked with grief, and to avenge her son's death, launches a modern-day witch-hunt to get \"justice\", no matter what the cost.",

Ellis, a demoted detective, has unfortunately spent the last year on the maritime unit, while Max has been living a transient life elaborately scamming everyone she meets. But when Max gets arrested and ends up helping Ellis solve a local crime, the two are offered the opportunity to redeem themselves, with Ellis going back to detective and Max staying out of jail. The catch? They have to work together, with each using their unique skills to solve crimes. For Ellis, that means hard-boiled shoe leather police work; for Max, it means accents, schemes and generally befriending everyone in sight, while driving Ellis absolutely nuts. Against the backdrop of beautiful Vancouver — with all its unique, charming, and even contradictory neighbourhoods and subcultures — the two will have to learn what it means to trust another person and maybe actually become partners.",

Karol is ready to list it. She's fed up with the dated décor, the tiny kitchen that can't fit the washing machine, and the single bathroom. But Richard is convinced that these issues can be solved. He would rather use the £22,000 potential moving costs to improve their house, but after 18 months of stasis, he needs Kirstie's help to find a way forward. Working with a £60,000 Love It budget, Kirstie proposes an internal reconfiguration to bring balance back to the home. But with Richard adjusting her plans from the beginning, she must draw on all her expertise to keep the project on course. Meanwhile, Phil faces his own challenges, finding sun-kissed gardens to satisfy Karol and enough kitchen storage for Richard, all within his £525,000 List It budget."

From the endless light of summer to the deep freeze of winter, each one-hour episode captures these men and women as they patrol the vast frontier by land, sea, and air. Alaska is the final stop for fugitives on the run, where danger is vast, distances are brutal, and backup can be hours away. From multi-agency criminal takedowns to life-saving search and rescue missions, the series showcases a range of calls Alaska State Troopers face that are as immense and unpredictable as the state itself.",

The fast-paced, drama-filled docu-series follows six Charleston singles — Craig Conover, Cameran Eubanks, Jenna King, Thomas Ravenel, Shepard \"Shep\" Rose, and Whitney Sudler Smith — struggling with the constraints of this tight-knit, posh society. The cast, some descendants of Vice Presidents and four-term Senators, and others from \"new money,\" is comprised of Southern bachelors who suffer from \"Peter Pan Syndrome\" by refusing to settle down; and the women in their lives who challenge them to grow up. Viewers will see them launch political careers, build businesses, break hearts, and chase true love -- all while struggling to preserve their family names. Because in Charleston, you're only as good as your last garden party and one social screw-up can taint generations to come.",

Pawning was the leading form of consumer credit in the United States until the 1950s, and pawn shops are still helping everyday people make ends meet. Pawn Stars takes you inside the colorful world of the pawn business. At the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop on the outskirts of Las Vegas, three generations of the Harrison family - grandfather Richard, son Rick and grandson Corey - jointly run the family business, and there's clashing and camaraderie every step of the way. The three men use their sharp eyes and skills to assess the value of items from the commonplace to the truly historic, including a 16th-century samurai sword, a Super Bowl ring, a Picasso painting and a 17th-century stay of execution. It's up to them to determine what's real and what's fake, as they reveal the often surprising answer to the questions on everyone's mind, \"What's the story behind it?\" and \"What's it worth?\"",

For the lobstermen, it's their last chance to put money in the bank until the fishing grounds re-open in spring. The Southern Ocean is Australia's deadliest stretch of ocean. Against a backdrop of wild weather and treacherous seas, crews work night and day to haul in hundreds of kilograms of lobsters across slippery decks. Even a minor problem can turn deadly in a matter of moments and the nearest port is often hundreds of nautical miles away.",

And if they did, why? Whether the motivation is revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. Each episode of Snapped chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.",

          "overview": "Paddy McGuinness explores the secrets of the McCain factory near Scarborough to reveal how it cuts, fries and freezes 80 million chips a day. Today, he's following production of their best seller, the straight cut frozen Home Chips.Of course, when it comes to making chips, the main ingredient is potatoes. And as Paddy steps out to the delivery yard, a lorry full of 28 tonnes of them has just arrived. Welcoming in one of up to 70 lorry loads that the factory receives a day is operations manager Mike Hartnett. He tells Paddy that on the back of the lorry is a special variety of potato called ‘Daisy', which is perfect for making chips. And on the back of one lorry are enough potatoes to make 1.7 million chips! Paddy can't quite get his head around the sheer numbers involved at this factory, and he's even more blown away when Mike tells him that it'll only take two hours to transform this load of spuds into frozen chips!After passing a series of rigorous tests to check they have the correct starch content, the potatoes snake their way through the enormous factory on a series of conveyor belts. Half an hour into the process, Paddy is keen to find out more about Mike, asking him what condiment he prefers on his chips. To his horror, Mike tells him brown sauce! Wishing he hadn't asked, Paddy follows Mike and the spuds through a series of washers which remove stones and soil. Then it's on to the peeler, where Paddy leaves ‘Brown Sauce Mike' behind and meets production director Ashley Bowsley. To Paddy's amazement, Ashley tells him that they use an advanced steam peeling method which ‘explodes' the skin off the potato, minimising waste.The next important production step is another hi-tech one. Instead of parboiling the potatoes to soften them, as you might do at home, they travel through a Pulsed Electric Field machine. Paddy learns that it sends electric pulses into the water that the spuds travel through, which softens them ready for cutting into chips. He states, ‘the amount of stuff what goes on with a humble chip in here is amazing.' And it doesn't end there, as the spuds travel through a cutting machine at 60 miles per hour, flying through a series of blades which transform them into chips. The result is spectacular, as Paddy sees 1.7 million chips cascade down a chip waterfall every hour. Just 67 minutes into the production process, he gets his hands on a chip.The freshly-cut chips travel along huge conveyor belts from one hi-tech machine to another, and Paddy and Ashley are hot on their heels. The next process is another surprise: battering. Every chip is coated in a light batter, to create extra crispness after you've cooked them in the oven at home. Then, the chips are sent through a fryer, followed by a freezer and onto the vast packing hall, where Paddy's co-presenter Cherry is waiting for him. She's done a bit of genning up on the equipment and talks Paddy through the complicated process of weighing out the chips and putting them into one-kilogram bags.Finally, the packed frozen chips snake their way towards the distribution area, where Ashley is waiting for Paddy and explains how an automated system loads 26 pallets onto the back of a waiting lorry. After just two hours, 1.7 million chips head out of the factory to be enjoyed with everything from sausages and beans to pies and pasties.Elsewhere in the episode, Cherry delves into the science behind malt vinegar production and heads to a farm in the West Midlands which is busy harvesting potatoes for the chip factory, while historian Ruth Goodman tucks into the origins of everyone's favourite seaside dish, fish and chips."

          "overview": "Paddy McGuinness explores the secrets of the McCain factory near Scarborough to reveal how it cuts, fries and freezes 80 million chips a day. Today, he's following production of their best seller, the straight cut frozen Home Chips.Of course, when it comes to making chips, the main ingredient is potatoes. And as Paddy steps out to the delivery yard, a lorry full of 28 tonnes of them has just arrived. Welcoming in one of up to 70 lorry loads that the factory receives a day is operations manager Mike Hartnett. He tells Paddy that on the back of the lorry is a special variety of potato called ‘Daisy', which is perfect for making chips. And on the back of one lorry are enough potatoes to make 1.7 million chips! Paddy can't quite get his head around the sheer numbers involved at this factory, and he's even more blown away when Mike tells him that it'll only take two hours to transform this load of spuds into frozen chips!After passing a series of rigorous tests to check they have the correct starch content, the potatoes snake their way through the enormous factory on a series of conveyor belts. Half an hour into the process, Paddy is keen to find out more about Mike, asking him what condiment he prefers on his chips. To his horror, Mike tells him brown sauce! Wishing he hadn't asked, Paddy follows Mike and the spuds through a series of washers which remove stones and soil. Then it's on to the peeler, where Paddy leaves ‘Brown Sauce Mike' behind and meets production director Ashley Bowsley. To Paddy's amazement, Ashley tells him that they use an advanced steam peeling method which ‘explodes' the skin off the potato, minimising waste.The next important production step is another hi-tech one. Instead of parboiling the potatoes to soften them, as you might do at home, they travel through a Pulsed Electric Field machine. Paddy learns that it sends electric pulses into the water that the spuds travel through, which softens them ready for cutting into chips. He states, ‘the amount of stuff what goes on with a humble chip in here is amazing.'

      "description": "The series, presented by former Scotland Yard Homicide Detective Inspector Steve Keogh, invites viewers into the intriguing realm of crime solving. With 30 years of experience under his belt including twelve years of service as a murder detective at the Metropolitan Police, Steve is opening up his contact books for the first time to reveal the secrets of what it really takes to be a murder detective on the frontline.Each episode unfolds as a gripping narrative, with Steve setting the scene and tone of each murder case. The series takes viewers on an immersive journey through the crime and  its investigation, from the beginning to the pivotal breakthrough leading to conviction. Steve provides unique and authentic insights into the intricate workings of investigations and the minds of detectives, bringing viewers into the heart of each case.In the series, we'll see Steve in conversation with leading officers on each case, as they share personal  memories of the investigations. Additionally, viewers will also hear from key experts and family members for each case, as the investigation's timeline is followed. Another key focus of the series is the use of modern investigative techniques and tools and the innovative ways experts on each case use these to solve the murders.Cases include the story of soap actress Sian Blake and her two sons, who were murdered by her partner in 2015 and how the investigation evolved from a mid-risk missing person case to a homicide one. The series also explores the 2013 murder of 17-years-old Champion Ganda, who was a victim of a knife crime in East London. The episode gives viewers first-hand insight by Steve and other investigators who worked on the case, into the difficulties of similar cases with lack of leads and suspects. In another episode, viewers will learn more about Dena Thompson, known in the British press as ‘The Black Widow' and the investigation into the deaths of her previous partners.Secrets of a Murder Detective offers a riveting blend of suspense, education and celebration of exceptional detective work, providing viewers with a unique behind-the-scenes look at recent cases.",

In the majestic mountains of Utah is a hidden social circle made up of successful women who have created their own paradise filled with luxury homes, shopping sprees and multi-million-dollar businesses and brands. With Hollywood's exclusive Sundance Film Festival in their backyards, these Type-A power-brokers are accustomed to rubbing elbows with A-listers and what party list you are on means everything. They have mastered running wildly successful enterprises by day and enjoy après ski at the finest resorts by night, all the while raising extraordinary and unconventional families. Here perfection is not an aspiration, it's a mandate. They hold themselves and each other to an extremely high standard and never hold back when things go sideways, but lord knows they are always there for each other when they need it most.",

America's secret super-weapon was lauded for bringing about victory in the Pacific and ending World War II. President Truman's official announcement included half-truths that  shaped the government's official narrative: \"Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese army base.\" In fact, the bomb was aimed at Hiroshima's city center for maximum psychological effect; the army base on its outskirts escaped much damage.Eighty years after the devastating atomic bombings that ushered in the nuclear age, Bombshell explores how the U.S. government manipulated the narrative about the impact of the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Through propaganda, censorship, and the co-opting of the press, the government presented a benevolent picture of atomic power, minimizing the horrific human toll. Bombshell sheds light on the efforts of a group of intrepid reporters to let the world know the truth."
