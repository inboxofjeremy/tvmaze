      "description": "The Price is Right, originally hosted by Bob Barker until 2007 and Drew Carey thereafter -- features a wide variety of games and contests with the same basic challenge: Guess the prices of everyday (or not-quite-everyday) retail items. Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the \"Showcase Showdown\". The two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. A trio of models presents the prizes.",

But when Max gets arrested and ends up helping Ellis solve a local crime, the two are offered the opportunity to redeem themselves, with Ellis going back to detective and Max staying out of jail. The catch? They have to work together, with each using their unique skills to solve crimes. For Ellis, that means hard-boiled shoe leather police work; for Max, it means accents, schemes and generally befriending everyone in sight, while driving Ellis absolutely nuts. Against the backdrop of beautiful Vancouver — with all its unique, charming, and even contradictory neighbourhoods and subcultures — the two will have to learn what it means to trust another person and maybe actually become partners.",

Karol is ready to list it. She's fed up with the dated décor, the tiny kitchen that can't fit the washing machine, and the single bathroom. But Richard is convinced that these issues can be solved. He would rather use the £22,000 potential moving costs to improve their house, but after 18 months of stasis, he needs Kirstie's help to find a way forward. Working with a £60,000 Love It budget, Kirstie proposes an internal reconfiguration to bring balance back to the home. But with Richard adjusting her plans from the beginning, she must draw on all her expertise to keep the project on course. Meanwhile, Phil faces his own challenges, finding sun-kissed gardens to satisfy Karol and enough kitchen storage for Richard, all within his £525,000 List It budget."

The cast, some descendants of Vice Presidents and four-term Senators, and others from \"new money,\" is comprised of Southern bachelors who suffer from \"Peter Pan Syndrome\" by refusing to settle down; and the women in their lives who challenge them to grow up. Viewers will see them launch political careers, build businesses, break hearts, and chase true love -- all while struggling to preserve their family names. Because in Charleston, you're only as good as your last garden party and one social screw-up can taint generations to come.",

Pawning was the leading form of consumer credit in the United States until the 1950s, and pawn shops are still helping everyday people make ends meet. Pawn Stars takes you inside the colorful world of the pawn business. At the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop on the outskirts of Las Vegas, three generations of the Harrison family - grandfather Richard, son Rick and grandson Corey - jointly run the family business, and there's clashing and camaraderie every step of the way. The three men use their sharp eyes and skills to assess the value of items from the commonplace to the truly historic, including a 16th-century samurai sword, a Super Bowl ring, a Picasso painting and a 17th-century stay of execution. It's up to them to determine what's real and what's fake, as they reveal the often surprising answer to the questions on everyone's mind, \"What's the story behind it?\" and \"What's it worth?\"",

This city, long a magnet for Grand Tourists, enchants with its artistic splendour and architectural majesty. The sight of Filippo Brunelleschi's magnificent Dome leaves Tom awe-struck. Guided by his ever-knowledgeable tutor, or \"bear leader,\" he stands before Michelangelo's iconic David and gains rare, private access to the Uffizi Gallery. There, he marvels at one of its crowning jewels - Botticelli's 'The Birth of Venus'.Inspired by the greats, Tom visits master sculptor Raffaello Romanelli to try his hand at shaping a clay bust, following in the footsteps of countless Grand Tourists who once came to Florence to study art, architecture, and sculpture in this romantic, cultural haven.Tom's journey then leads him to Rome, the pinnacle of the Grand Tour. With its layers of ancient history and vibrant artistic life, the Eternal City was a place where British travellers often lingered for months, even years. At the historic Caffè Greco - a gathering spot for thinkers and artists - Tom learns that just across the street lies the Keats-Shelley House, the final home of the romantic poet John Keats.In true Grand Tourist fashion, Tom commissions a portrait - not the flattering ideal often painted by local artists, but a revealing portrayal of his true self, with striking results. As his time in Rome draws to a close, he embraces its timeless romance, joining street musicians to serenade passing lovers - and as his voice rises, hearts melt.The Grand Tour was meant to transform its participants, to broaden horizons and deepen the soul. Reflecting on his own odyssey through Europe, Tom wonders: how has he changed, and what has he discovered on his very own journey?"

The stars will be transformed and they will take on a masked identity and become a fantastic character which will disguise them for the whole series. Forget any thoughts of fancy dress – they'll be full-on, original, movie-standard creations taking inspiration from worlds as varied as manga, superheroes, and wild animals and mythical creatures. Their transformations will be total, even their speaking voices will be disguised in interviews. It will be up to a superstar panel to lead the viewers at home in their quest to discover who they are. Although the stars aren't judged on their voices, they'll still need to give their best performance – the audience's least favourite will be eliminated, before the panel try to guess their identity and unmask them.",

But none terrorized this city of millions more than the Hillside Strangler, a phantom who struck without warning, abducting, raping, and murdering a dozen women and girls and leaving their bodies displayed on the hillsides like grim trophies. These crimes sparked the largest manhunt in LA's blood-soaked history, led by a relentless homicide detective named Frank Salerno. His dogged pursuit led to the strangler's capture and the revelation that these vicious acts were perpetrated by two men, Kenneth Bianchi and his cousin Angelo Buono.",

The goal is to conquer the entire floor and take home a huge cash prize. The rules are simple. A random contestant challenges an adjoining opponent in a quiz duel. They play against each other in the category of the opponent's square. Categories range from 'famous athletes' to 'Hollywood actors' and from ‘iconic buildings' to 'mammals'. Some questions are visually supported by photographs, others by sound, while other duels focus on open questions, multiple choice, association: the possibilities are endless. The winner of a duel conquers his opponent's square, gaining more ground - the loser leaves the game. The further the game progresses, the more exciting the duels become and the higher the stakes. After ten episodes, who will be the last person standing on The Floor and take home the impressive cash prize?",

With a range of budgets and demanding clients, Dermot Bannon balances his role as designer with that of diplomat, mediator and project manager as he fights his corner with feisty contractors and has his diplomacy skills tested by clients who know exactly what they want.Exposed power lines, extensions built without foundations, unstable roofs, parasitic fungus, spiraling budgets, design dilemmas, slipping schedules, necessary compromise, unnecessary delays, absent homeowners, flights of fancy and frayed nerves - this series has it all.",

And if they did, why? Whether the motivation is revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. Each episode of Snapped chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.",

Actors Dean Cain, Ellen Cleghorne, Jaleel White and Barry Williams join reality stars Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley, Chris Soules and Kendra Wilkinson in boot camp.

Burrell is looking to extend her record to 5-2, while Ray looks to get the win in her first season.",

          "overview": "Paddy McGuinness explores the secrets of the Jammie Dodgers factory in south Wales, revealing how they produce a whopping 4.4 billion biscuits a year.In this episode, Paddy is in great spirits as he gets to know the factory staff, many of whom have worked there for decades. At this site, which has been making biscuits since 1939, Paddy's following the production of an icon in the biscuit world, the Jammie Dodger!First up, Paddy meets head of R&amp;D Gemma James and shift operations manager Jamie Caswell, who are weighing out some of the key ingredients for the biscuits, including a raising agent and a powder which acts as a butter replacement. But starting as he means to go on, Paddy wants to know an important fact: what do they dunk their biscuits into? To his mock horror, Gemma reveals it's a cup of herbal tea!Paddy and Gemma head to the mixing area, just in time to see a huge lump of biscuit dough exit an industrial mixer. The dough is transported to the biscuit-moulding area of the factory, where Paddy meets general manager Rebecca Phillips. But before he discovers how the biscuits are made, it's the same dunking question for Rebecca! This time, Paddy is delighted with her answer: ‘a strong cup of tea'. To make the biscuit sandwich, she tells him that a huge brass roller creates 2,880 Jammie Dodger tops and bottoms every minute.With the freshly moulded biscuits making their way through the factory, Paddy's taking the time to chat to members of staff, including a lady who has worked at the factory for an astonishing 30 years. Meanwhile, the biscuits travel through an epic conveyor oven, the length of eight double-decker buses, and after just eight minutes, they emerge a beautiful golden brown. Paddy can't resist having a taste – delicious, even without the jam, he says.To sort the ingredient that the Jammie Dodger is famous for, Paddy and factory manager Rebecca stop off at the ‘depositor', where precisely 4.8 grams of smooth, raspberry-flavoured jam is dolloped onto the bottom half of every biscuit. Then, almost immediately, small vacuum cups lift and place the top halves to make the perfect jam sandwich. Paddy is given a very special taste, something his six-year-old self would have loved: biting into a warm Dodger straight off the line. He's in biscuit heaven!Paddy follows the finished biscuits through the vast factory and watches as they're wrapped in packs of eight and travel on towards the packing department. There, Rebecca has a challenge for him – helping Jenny put the packets into boxes ready to leave the factory. Jenny has worked at the factory for over 34 years and even met her husband there. She makes the process of precisely placing the packs of biscuits into boxes look easy, but as Paddy finds out with hilarious consequences, it's anything but. Jumping ship, he leaves Jenny and her colleagues to clean up his mess and follows his biscuits to the dispatch area, where half a million jammy biscuits get loaded onto the back of a lorry and leave the site. Every day, four or five lorries leave the factory, which is capable of producing 2.2 million Dodgers a day.Elsewhere in the episode, Cherry is astonished as she and a former Great British Bake Off contestant test which biscuit, scientifically speaking, is best for dunking. And she heads to a bakery near Leeds to learn how luscious marshmallows are made. Meanwhile, historian Ruth Goodman reveals how a million women risked their lives during the Second World War to provide a brew and biscuit where it was needed most. And she visits the site of an old biscuit factory, revealing a remarkable old film from 1906, showing how the factory in ‘Biscuit Town' in London produced hundreds of millions of biscuits a year."

          "overview": "Paddy McGuinness explores the secrets of the McCain factory near Scarborough to reveal how it cuts, fries and freezes 80 million chips a day. Today, he's following production of their best seller, the straight cut frozen Home Chips.Of course, when it comes to making chips, the main ingredient is potatoes. And as Paddy steps out to the delivery yard, a lorry full of 28 tonnes of them has just arrived. Welcoming in one of up to 70 lorry loads that the factory receives a day is operations manager Mike Hartnett. He tells Paddy that on the back of the lorry is a special variety of potato called ‘Daisy', which is perfect for making chips. And on the back of one lorry are enough potatoes to make 1.7 million chips! Paddy can't quite get his head around the sheer numbers involved at this factory, and he's even more blown away when Mike tells him that it'll only take two hours to transform this load of spuds into frozen chips!After passing a series of rigorous tests to check they have the correct starch content, the potatoes snake their way through the enormous factory on a series of conveyor belts. Half an hour into the process, Paddy is keen to find out more about Mike, asking him what condiment he prefers on his chips. To his horror, Mike tells him brown sauce! Wishing he hadn't asked, Paddy follows Mike and the spuds through a series of washers which remove stones and soil. Then it's on to the peeler, where Paddy leaves ‘Brown Sauce Mike' behind and meets production director Ashley Bowsley. To Paddy's amazement, Ashley tells him that they use an advanced steam peeling method which ‘explodes' the skin off the potato, minimising waste.The next important production step is another hi-tech one. Instead of parboiling the potatoes to soften them, as you might do at home, they travel through a Pulsed Electric Field machine. Paddy learns that it sends electric pulses into the water that the spuds travel through, which softens them ready for cutting into chips. He states, ‘the amount of stuff what goes on with a humble chip in here is amazing.' And it doesn't end there, as the spuds travel through a cutting machine at 60 miles per hour, flying through a series of blades which transform them into chips. The result is spectacular, as Paddy sees 1.7 million chips cascade down a chip waterfall every hour. Just 67 minutes into the production process, he gets his hands on a chip.The freshly-cut chips travel along huge conveyor belts from one hi-tech machine to another, and Paddy and Ashley are hot on their heels. The next process is another surprise: battering. Every chip is coated in a light batter, to create extra crispness after you've cooked them in the oven at home. Then, the chips are sent through a fryer, followed by a freezer and onto the vast packing hall, where Paddy's co-presenter Cherry is waiting for him. She's done a bit of genning up on the equipment and talks Paddy through the complicated process of weighing out the chips and putting them into one-kilogram bags.Finally, the packed frozen chips snake their way towards the distribution area, where Ashley is waiting for Paddy and explains how an automated system loads 26 pallets onto the back of a waiting lorry. After just two hours, 1.7 million chips head out of the factory to be enjoyed with everything from sausages and beans to pies and pasties.Elsewhere in the episode, Cherry delves into the science behind malt vinegar production and heads to a farm in the West Midlands which is busy harvesting potatoes for the chip factory, while historian Ruth Goodman tucks into the origins of everyone's favourite seaside dish, fish and chips."

In each episode, host Eric Adjepong takes over the test kitchen after hours with an exclusive invitation for three chefs to bring $5,000 to play across three hands of his underground culinary poker game.  The competitors, who all know each other well, have scores to settle and personal stakes to lose as they battle to create dishes based on the cards they are dealt and bet using their own instincts and cold hard cash.  The luck of the draw determines the dishes and cooking time, while wildcards deal unpredictable challenges into the mix that test the chefs like never before. From surf-and-turf with peanut butter to live crab with kimchi, anything can happen in Wildcard Kitchen as mystery guest judges use blind taste tests to determine who walks away the high roller with bragging rights and cash from their fellow chefs.",

In this tumultuous world Merlin, the son of an Atlantean princess and the bard, Taliesen, pursues his father's vision of a Kingdom of Summer — a Britain unified in peace. But to achieve this dream, Merlin will have to overcome ancient evils and navigate both the fall of the Roman occupation and the rise of Christianity in search of a king who can unite the Island of the Mighty.",

The fate of each untrained contestant in the wilderness lies in the hands of their family members back in HQ. Each amateur survivalist's family has the power to decide whether their loved one has what it takes to brave the elements and fight to be the last one standing, or whether the family will push the ominous \"Extract\" button and remove their loved one and their whole family from the competition. Extracted begs the question: how far will their loved ones let them go for a chance for their family to win $250,000?",

          "overview": "On August 6, 1945, a revolutionary new weapon destroyed Hiroshima, a Japanese city of 300,000 inhabitants. Three days later, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. America's secret super-weapon was lauded for bringing about victory in the Pacific and ending World War II. President Truman's official announcement included half-truths that  shaped the government's official narrative: \"Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese army base.\" In fact, the bomb was aimed at Hiroshima's city center for maximum psychological effect; the army base on its outskirts escaped much damage.Eighty years after the devastating atomic bombings that ushered in the nuclear age, Bombshell explores how the U.S. government manipulated the narrative about the impact of the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Through propaganda, censorship, and the co-opting of the press, the government presented a benevolent picture of atomic power, minimizing the horrific human toll. Bombshell sheds light on the efforts of a group of intrepid reporters to let the world know the truth."
